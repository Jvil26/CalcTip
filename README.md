## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

One challenge I encountered was with implementing the UIPicker so users could select the background color for the app. There were multiple steps in setting up the components, number of rows, the title in each row, and lastly, the code that runs when a user selects a specific color in the UIPicker.

The biggest challenge for me was creating the settings page and passing the data between view controllers. It took a lot of trial and error before I was finally able to get the data on the view controller from the settings view controller.
